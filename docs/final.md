[Our Application](http://get-out-jail-free.herokuapp.com/)

## Information Problem
There are currently many resources that help prevent crime, but not many exist to help *commit* crime. Criminals are an underrepresented population, and many of them have a hard time supporting their families.

## Stakeholders
Criminals, or aspiring criminals in Montgomery County, MD. They will be able to use our app on any mobile device and laptop/desktop.

## Data
We used data from the Montgomery County Crime dataset, which can be found here [MoCo crime data](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime/icn6-v9z3).
Zip codes were originally found at [Zip Codes](https://gist.github.com/erichurst/7882666).
We used python and [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/browse/homes/md/montgomery-county/) to filter for MoCo zip codes.

## Strategies & Solutions
## Technical system decision rationale
## Final System
## Challenges & Impact
For our app to work, we needed access to zip codes which the dataset we were originally going to work with didn't provide. We had to look for another dataset and stumbled upon the crime data for Montgomery County. This dataset allowed us to implement our dataset smoothly. 
## Future Work
Some next steps would be to add additional functionality to the map such as user input and display various statistics to the user. This app may even be able to expand to show more counties in Maryland. 
Another future direction would be to transform the current map into a heatmap, which would be more visually appealing to the users.
